brew services start rust-sci-hub-mcp

# Start the service and enable it to start at login
brew services restart rust-sci-hub-mcp
```

### Checking Service Status

```bash
# List all Homebrew services
brew services list

# Check only rust-sci-hub-mcp status
brew services list | grep rust-sci-hub-mcp

# Get detailed service information
brew services info rust-sci-hub-mcp
```

### Stopping the Service

```bash
# Stop the service
brew services stop rust-sci-hub-mcp

# Stop and disable from starting at login
brew services stop rust-sci-hub-mcp --all
```

### Restarting the Service

# View all logs
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/rust-sci-hub-mcp/*.log
```

## Configuration

### Default Configuration

After installation, a default configuration is created at:
```
~/.config/rust-sci-hub-mcp/config.toml
```

### Editing Configuration

```bash
# Edit the configuration file
brew services stop rust-sci-hub-mcp
nano ~/.config/rust-sci-hub-mcp/config.toml
brew services start rust-sci-hub-mcp
```

### Configuration Options

Key configuration sections:

```toml
[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"          # Bind address
port = 8080                 # HTTP port
health_check_interval_secs = 60

[sci_hub]
mirrors = []                # Auto-discovered if empty
timeout_secs = 30
retry_attempts = 3
rate_limit_requests_per_minute = 30

[downloads]
directory = "~/Downloads/papers"
concurrent_downloads = 3
chunk_size_bytes = 8192

[logging]
level = "info"
file = "~/Library/Logs/rust-sci-hub-mcp/service.log"
```

### Reloading Configuration

```bash
# The service supports configuration reload via SIGHUP
brew services restart rust-sci-hub-mcp

# Or send the signal directly
pkill -HUP rust-sci-hub-mcp
```

## Health Checks

The service provides health check endpoints:

```bash
# Basic health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Detailed health information
curl http://localhost:8080/health | jq .

# Check specific probes
curl http://localhost:8080/health/live     # Liveness probe
curl http://localhost:8080/health/ready    # Readiness probe
curl http://localhost:8080/health/startup  # Startup probe
```

## Upgrading

### Check for Updates

```bash
# Update Homebrew and check for updates
brew update
brew outdated | grep rust-sci-hub-mcp
```

### Upgrade the Package

```bash
# Upgrade to the latest version
brew upgrade rust-sci-hub-mcp

# The service will be automatically restarted after upgrade
```

### Version Information

```bash
# Check installed version
brew list --versions rust-sci-hub-mcp

# Check running version

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**Problem**: Formula not found
```bash
Error: No available formula with name "rust-sci-hub-mcp"
```
**Solution**:
```bash
# Add the tap first
brew tap yourusername/rust-sci-hub-mcp
# Then install
brew install rust-sci-hub-mcp
```

**Problem**: Build errors
```bash
Error: rust-sci-hub-mcp: failed to build
```
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check dependencies
brew doctor
# Update Homebrew
brew update
# Try building from source
brew install --build-from-source rust-sci-hub-mcp
```

### Service Issues

**Problem**: Service won't start
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/rust-sci-hub-mcp/stderr.log

# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :8080

# Check service status
brew services list | grep rust-sci-hub-mcp
```

**Problem**: Service crashes repeatedly
```bash
# Check configuration
rust-sci-hub-mcp --config ~/.config/rust-sci-hub-mcp/config.toml --dry-run

# Check system resources
top -pid $(pgrep rust-sci-hub-mcp)

# Reset to default configuration
brew services stop rust-sci-hub-mcp
rm ~/.config/rust-sci-hub-mcp/config.toml
brew services start rust-sci-hub-mcp
```

### Permission Issues

**Problem**: Permission denied errors
```bash
# Fix configuration file permissions
chmod 600 ~/.config/rust-sci-hub-mcp/config.toml

# Fix log directory permissions
chown -R $(whoami) ~/Library/Logs/rust-sci-hub-mcp/
```

### Network Issues

**Problem**: Health check fails
```bash
# Check if service is running
pgrep rust-sci-hub-mcp

# Check listening ports
netstat -an | grep 8080

# Test with verbose curl
curl -v http://localhost:8080/health
```
